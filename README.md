# 09 Node.js Homework: Professional README Generator
## Description
A professional README generator, the user responds to inquirer prompts, and are given a README based on their input. As I did this assignment after the Team Profile Generator assignment, the work here was basically doing a simpler version of that assignment, I was abke to reference code from the assignment since they were so similar.
